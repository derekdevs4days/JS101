Input: string
Output: array containing words from our string arguement with a number representing the length of that word.
Rules: words are separated by space
if emptystring or no arguement return empty arr

Algorithm: 
- declare a variable name stringArr and initialize it to an array containing our string
- map stringArr and return word + length of word
- return the mapped stringArr

Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns an array that contains every word from the string, with each word followed by a space and the word's length. If the argument is an empty string or if no argument is passed, the function should return an empty array.

You may assume that every pair of words in the string will be separated by a single space.

Examples:
wordLengths('cow sheep chicken');
// ["cow 3", "sheep 5", "chicken 7"]

wordLengths('baseball hot dogs and apple pie');
// ["baseball 8", "hot 3", "dogs 4", "and 3", "apple 5", "pie 3"]

wordLengths("It ain't easy, is it?");
// ["It 2", "ain't 5", "easy, 5", "is 2", "it? 3"]

wordLengths('Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious');
// ["Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious 34"]

wordLengths('');      // []
wordLengths();        // []
 */

function wordLengths(string) {
  if (!string) return [];

  const stringArr = string.split(' ');
  return stringArr.map(word => `${word} ${word.length}`);
}

console.log(wordLengths('cow sheep chicken'));
console.log(wordLengths('baseball hot dogs and apple pie'));
console.log(wordLengths("It ain't easy, is it?"));
console.log(wordLengths('Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious'));
console.log(wordLengths(''));
console.log(wordLengths());
